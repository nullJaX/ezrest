    (Async)Endpoint [Builder]

    This class allows for generating endpoint URLs dynamically without
    hardcoding endpoint suffixes and uses (Async)Connector instance to
    perform requests.

    The (Async)Endpoint usage is explained in the following snippet.
    There is no significant difference between synchronous and asynchronous
    version other than the class names used. Each example will generate a
    copy of the (Async)Endpoint with modified URL, but the (Async)Connector
    instance will be shared with the newly created (Async)Endpoint. On each
    (Async)Endpoint one can call methods implemented in the (Async)Connector.
    Note, however, that these methods don't accept URL as the first argument,
    it is automatically injected. The rest of the arguments are passed through
    without any modifications.

    Examples:

    base_url = 'http://x.com/'

    connector = Connector[Dict[str, Any]] ()

    api_root = Endpoint(base_url, connector)

    api_root                # http://x.com/
